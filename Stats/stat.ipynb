    "Q1.A university wants to understand the relationship between the SAT scores of its applicants and their college GPA. They collect data on 500 students, including their SAT scores (out of 1600) and their college GPA (on a 4.0 scale). They find that the correlation coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA is 0.7. What does this correlation coefficient indicate about the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, our dataset has two features. SAT scores and college GPA are the two examples. SAT scores and college GPA have a 0.7 correlation.The range of potential values when calculating the association between SAT scores and college GPA is from -1 to 1. We may say that there is a positive link between SAT scores and college GPA if the number is closer to 1. We can claim that there is a negative connection between SAT scores if the value is closer to -1. If the number is zero, there is no relationship between SAT scores and college GPA.link coefficient value in this case is 0.7, indicating a favourable link between SAT results and college GPA. It indicates that it is more likely that we will have excellent SAT Scores if we have a high GPA."
